                <p>While there is a lot to learn, discover, and explore in the tradition of yoga, it is best to start simply and not let yourself be overwhelmed. Our How to Start a Yoga Practice guide will give you the 4 basic steps to starting a yoga practice. We have kept this list short and sweet to make it accessible and easy to accomplish!</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are four basic steps to getting started with yoga. We have kept this list to the bare minimum–there is almost an endless amount to learn about both the physical yoga practices as well as the philosophical underpinnings of yoga. Once you have worked through this list, continue on with our Yoga for Beginner’s section and keep adding to your journey as it feels appropriate.</p>
                <br>
                <strong>1. Learn how to breathe</strong>
                <br>
                <p>The most important thing to do in yoga is to breathe, especially when holding the postures. Learn the basic Dirga pranayama breath to use during yoga. Most importantly, breathe in and out through the nose into the belly. Read our Breathing in Asana article for more advice on breathing while practicing yoga poses. Most importantly, let your breath be your guide throughout your yoga practice.</p>
                <br>
                <strong>2. Start with a brief meditation and intention</strong>
                <br>
                <p>Sit in easy pose or accomplished pose (or any comfortable seating position) and take a few minutes to ground, center and focus inwards with one of our meditations. You may also want to set an intention, goal or prayer for your practice at the beginning meditation.</p>
                <br>
                <strong>3. Use basic and beginning level postures</strong>
                <p>Make sure you have read our General Practice Guidelines before attempting any yoga poses. Start with one of our warm-up sequences and then try one of our basic yoga pose sequences and/or these simple postures: seated twist, cat, dog, down dog, child, cobra, mountain, triangle, forward bend. Then check out our list of best poses for beginners and explore our Yoga Pose section to find additional poses to add to your practice. It is best to add new poses very slowly.</p>
                <strong>4. End with Shavasana (relaxation pose)</strong>
                <p>Always end your yoga practice with Shavasana, resting on your back and consciously relaxing your body for 5-15 minutes. It is also recommended to practice a short seated meditation after Shavasana to integrate your yoga practice and transition back into the world.</p>

                <h2>4 Truths About Yoga</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The saying ‘better late than never’ defines my journey with yoga. It took me 16 years between trying it for the first time and having a bad experience to giving it another go. I go into detail in, ‘a modern love story with a practice centuries old.’</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I reflect on why I didn’t have a great first impression, it was a combination of factors that I’m sure you currently think or feel the same way if you’re new to yoga.</p>

                    <li>It’s just stretching,</li>
                    <li>It’s not fast paced enough for me,</li>
                    <li>I’m not familiar with the names of the poses,</li>
                    <li>They’re chanting in another language and I’m not sure if I’m supposed to,</li>
                    <li>There’s strong scents in the studio. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The biggest issue I had as a beginner to yoga was to get into shoulder stand in my first class.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I found it confronting.</p>

                <p>Fast forward to 2020, yoga is the fastest growing fitness or sporting activity as it evolves from its mystical roots to now being present in modern gyms and boutique studios. Instructors have different teaching styles from slow, restorative sequences to high cardio to power and precision. The experience from teacher to teacher in the same studio will also be variable. </p>
                <p>Let me share a few truths that I’ve learnt along the way.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yoga is not just stretching,</li>
                    <li>Yoga styles vary from fast paced and sweaty to precision and alignment to yin and relaxing,</li>
                    <li>Yoga has deep roots which includes its Sanskrit heritage and rituals,</li>
                    <li>Yoga is more than just a physical practice. It’s an experience that tends to all your senses.</li>

                <h2>Yoga decreases stress</h2>

                <p>Yoga is known for its ability to ease stress and promote relaxation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In fact, multiple studies have shown that it can decrease the secretion of cortisol, the primary stress hormone </p>
                <br>
                <p>One study demonstrated the powerful effect of yoga on stress by following 24 women who perceived themselves as emotionally distressed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After a three-month yoga program, the women had significantly lower levels of cortisol. They also had lower levels of stress, anxiety, fatigue and depression (4Trusted Source).

                    Another study of 131 people had similar results, showing that 10 weeks of yoga helped reduce stress and anxiety. It also helped improve quality of life and mental health (5Trusted Source).
                    
                    When used alone or along with other methods of alleviating stress, such as meditation, yoga can be a powerful way to keep stress in check.</p>

                <h2>Relieves Anxiety</h2>
                <video src="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga?jwsource=cl" controls>Mindfull Moves</video>
                <p>Many people begin practicing yoga as a way to cope with feelings of anxiety.

                    Interestingly enough, there is quite a bit of research showing that yoga can help reduce anxiety.
                    
                    In one study, 34 women diagnosed with an anxiety disorder participated in yoga classes twice weekly for two months.
                    
                    At the end of the study, those who practiced yoga had significantly lower levels of anxiety than the control group (6Trusted Source).
                    
                    Another study followed 64 women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by severe anxiety and fear following exposure to a traumatic event.
                    
                    After 10 weeks, the women who practiced yoga once weekly had fewer symptoms of PTSD. In fact, 52% of participants no longer met the criteria for PTSD at all (7Trusted Source).
                    
                    It’s not entirely clear exactly how yoga is able to reduce symptoms of anxiety. However, it emphasizes the importance of being present in the moment and finding a sense of peace, which could help treat anxiety.</p>

                <h2>May Reduce Inflammation</h2>
                <p>studies show that yoga may reduce inflammatory markers in the body and help
                    prevent pro-inflammatory diseases.</p>
